abstract: >-
  Social dining, i.e., eating with/in company, is replete with meaning
  and cultural signifcance. Unfortunately, for the 1.8 million Ameri-
  cans with motor impairments who cannot eat without assistance,
  challenges restrict them from enjoying this pleasant social ritual.
  In this work, we identify the needs of participants with motor im-
  pairments during social dining and how robot-assisted feeding can
  address them. Using speculative videos that show robot behav-
  iors within a social dining context, we interviewed participants to
  understand their preferences. Following a community-based partic-
  ipatory research method, we worked with a community researcher
  with motor impairments throughout this study. We contribute (a)
  insights into how a robot can help overcome challenges in social
  dining, (b) design principles for creating robot-assisted feeding
  systems, (c) and an implementation guide for future research in
  this area. Our key fnding is that robots’ unique assistive qualities
  can address challenges people with motor impairments face during
  social dining, promoting empowerment and belonging.
