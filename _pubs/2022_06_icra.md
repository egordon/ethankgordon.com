  Robot-assisted feeding in household environments
  is challenging because it requires robots to generate trajectories
  that effectively bring food items of varying shapes and sizes into
  the mouth while making sure the user is comfortable. Our key
  insight is that in order to solve this challenge, robots must
  balance the efficiency of feeding a food item with the comfort
  of each individual bite. We formalize comfort and efficiency
  as heuristics to incorporate in motion planning. We present
  an approach based on heuristics-guided bi-directional Rapidly-
  exploring Random Trees (h-BiRRT) that selects bite transfer
  trajectories of arbitrary food item geometries and shapes using
  our developed bite efficiency and comfort heuristics and a
  learned constraint model. Real-robot evaluations show that op-
  timizing both comfort and efficiency significantly outperforms
  a fixed-pose based method, and users preferred our method
  significantly more than that of a method that maximizes only
  user comfort.
