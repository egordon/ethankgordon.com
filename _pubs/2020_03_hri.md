abstract: >-
  A robot-assisted feeding system can potentially help a user with
  upper-body mobility impairments eat independently. However, au-
  tonomous assistance in the real world is challenging because of
  varying user preferences, impairment constraints, and possibility of
  errors in uncertain and unstructured environments. An autonomous
  robot-assisted feeding system needs to decide the appropriate strat-
  egy to acquire a bite of hard-to-model deformable food items, the
  right time to bring the bite close to the mouth, and the appropriate
  strategy to transfer the bite easily. Our key insight is that a system
  should be designed based on a user’s preference about these vari-
  ous challenging aspects of the task. In this work, we explore user
  preferences for different modes of autonomy given perceived error
  risks and also analyze the effect of input modalities on technology
  acceptance. We found that more autonomy is not always better, as
  participants did not have a preference to use a robot with partial
  autonomy over a robot with low autonomy. In addition, partici-
  pants’ user interface preference changes from voice control during
  individual dining to web-based during social dining. Finally, we
  found differences on average ratings when grouping the partici-
  pants based on their mobility limitations (lower vs. higher) that
  suggests that ratings from participants with lower mobility limita-
  tions are correlated with higher expectations of robot performance.
